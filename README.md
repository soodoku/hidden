### Mis-measuring Political Knowledge? Do People Know More—or Even Less—about Politics than Commonly Thought?

It has long been widely accepted that the public knows very little about politics, but, over the past couple of decades, a number of prominent revisionist studies have claimed that it actually knows appreciably more than we have been thinking. The reasons lie in a mix of respondent behavior, the selection and design of knowledge questions, and the coding of the responses to open-ended ones. In a nutshell, incorrect and Don’t-Know responses may conceal knowledge; the questions may be too difficult, missing too much of what people do know; and the coding may count partially correct responses as incorrect. But while there may be some truth to such claims, this accounting neglects the other side of the ledger. Correct responses may reflect lucky guessing, shrewd inference, or mere belief (suspicion as distinct from knowledge), the questions may be too easy, missing too much of what people don’t know; and the respondents may be more knowledgeable than the citizenry from which they have been drawn. Here we provide a more comprehensive view.
